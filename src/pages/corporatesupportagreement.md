<a href="http://findynamics.com"><img className="float-image"src="/img/xbrl-analyst-logo.png" /> </a> "Excel-DNA is incredibly versatile and stable framework for building Excel add-ins and user-defined functions. With such a pivotal element in our project, we were very concerned about committing to Excel-DNA that was developed by an enthusiast. However, we quickly learned that Govert has created an outstanding open source project; that he is keen on helping with any challenging questions and that the community is active enough to sustain a healthy evolution of Excel-DNA."" – Ilya Vadeiko, <a href="http://findynamics.com/">FinDynamics</a>

<a href="http://solution7.co.uk"><img className="float-image"src="/img/s7logo.png" /> </a>“Excel-DNA is the open source project that quietly delivers a robust and simple to use extensibility framework for Microsoft Excel. When we felt we had outgrown VBA, no longer wanted the complexity of C++ and were thoroughly fed up with VSTO, Excel-DNA seemed a great choice and we haven’t been let down. 
</p>
<p>
In Excel-DNA, combined with his incredible understanding of Excel integration, the .Net framework and passion for wanting to help others, Govert continues to deliver a project that makes Excel-DNA a ‘no brainer’ choice.

<p>
Thank you to Govert and to everyone involved in Excel-DNA – well done.” – Simon Miles, <a href="http://solution7.co.uk/">Solution 7</a>
