I discovered a really nice write-up on “**[Excel-DNA Or Why Are You Still Using VBA?](https://medium.com/@efrem.sternbach/excel-dna-or-why-are-you-still-using-vba-a76f565884ff)**” by **Efrem J. Sternbach**. He gives a succinct one-page introduction to various Excel-DNA features including the ribbon integration and COM interop. A great start if you’re curious about Excel-DNA and still using VBA :-)
