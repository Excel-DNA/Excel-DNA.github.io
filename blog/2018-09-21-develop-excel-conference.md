Charles Williams of [FastExcel](https://fastexcel.wordpress.com/) fame is hosting a one-day conference in
London on 18 October, covering a wide range of Excel extensibility topics.

I will be presenting Excel-DNA, joining developers responsible for PyXLL,
Planatech XLL+, the new Javascript interfaces from Microsoft, and more.
Anyone interested in advanced Excel extensibility will get great insights
into the present and future of developing Excel-based solutions.
Please join us!

This is a community organized pay-if-you-can event, with contributions helping to defer speakers’ travel expenses.
